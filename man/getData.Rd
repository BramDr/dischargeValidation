\title{Get validation data object for further analysis}
\usage{
getData(obsFile, simFiles, locations, simOrigins = rep("0000-12-30",
  length(simFiles)), simVars = rep("OUT_DISCHARGE", length(simFiles)),
  simSkips = rep(0, length(simFiles)), obsOrigin = "1806-01-01",
  obsVar = "dis", attVars = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{obsFile}{Path to the observation file.}

\item{simFiles}{Path to the simulation file(s). This can also be an empty vector.}

\item{locations}{List of station locations containing lon/lat values in a vector.}

\item{simOrigins}{Date origin of the simulation(s). A value per simulation file is required. Defaults to VIC origin.}

\item{simVars}{Variable name of the simulation(s) to retreive. A value per simulation file is required. Defaults to VIC discharge variable.}

\item{simSkips}{Number of months to skip for the simulation(s). A value per simulation file is required. Defaults to 0.}

\item{obsOrigin}{Date origin of the observations.}

\item{obsVar}{Variable name of the observations to retreive.}

\item{attVars}{Variable name of attribute(s) to retrieve. If "all" is used, all attributes are retrieved. A variable is recognized as an attribute if it has only lon & lat dimensions (characters can have three dimensions to form strings).}
}
